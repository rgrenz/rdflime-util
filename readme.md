## rdflime-util
A collection of scripts and notebooks to replicate the results that have been reported in the corresponding thesis:

__RDF-LIME: Locally Faithful Model-Agnostic Explanations for Machine Learning on Knowledge Graph Embeddings__

> In case you just want to use the RDF-LIME extension of the LIME library, please refer to [rdflime-core](https://github.com/rgrenz/rdflime-core).

### Replicating the results
__1. Prerequisites__ Ideally, start from a clean Linux system with only Python 3 installed, e.g. using a fresh Python 3 docker image in the VS Code devcontainer environment.
