#### batch generation
The scripts in this folder are able to produce high numbers of explanations in an automated fashion. In essence, they use the same functionality that is also presented in the notebooks, but run without any interaction needed. However, they are highly adjusted to generate exactly what was needed for the thesis, so you may get a better overall ecpression by looking at the notebooks instead.

Note: These scripts must be placed directly in the /notebooks folder to work properly.
